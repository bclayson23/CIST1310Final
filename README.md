### Class Final Project for CIST 1310

### This project will be a page where guests can make reservations for the hotel.

This would be an example of a reservation system where users could go for a hotel and select when they would like to stay. They can also choose what type of room.

They will see a success/confirmation page after making a reservation.

They can also view a  list of existsing reservations for reference.
